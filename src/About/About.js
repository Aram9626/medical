                                    Neighborhood Care Hospice Inc. offers services to patients who have a terminal illness where the goal of treatment is pain management and symptom control with a limited life expectancy as diagnosed by the patientâ€™s physician.
                                    Hospice patients do not have to be homebound. Patients, however, must be aware of their condition and reside within the service area.
